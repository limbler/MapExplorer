<h2>about:</h2>
  <p>MapExplorer provides a simple format in which to create a journey through a 2D world.
  How you choose to use it is up to you. Will you create a visual world with many nooks and crannies to explore?
  Will you use it to tell a story, like a DIY adventure novel? Will you use it to craft funny little comics
  to share with your friends? Or will you come up with something entirely new and unexpected?</p>
  <p>Check out the <a href="broken">Tutorial</a> or the <a href="broken">Sample Projects</a> to see how it works</p>
</br>
<h3>privacy:</h3>
<p>ALL MAPS ARE PRIVATE UNTIL MANUALLY PUBLISHED BY THEIR CREATOR. Don't worry, if you want your map to be just for you, no one will ever see it but you.
You may chose to make your maps public at any time, but we will never make anything public without you initiating it. Unlike some OTHER social media platforms (*cough*Facebook*cough*).</p>
